-   #### Design

    -   ##### Colour Scheme
        -   The colour scheme for the website derives from a grayscale palette. The colours found on the website are off-white (#fafafa), dark grey (darkgrey), off-black (#474444)  with some icons being orange (#e98b11).

    -   ##### Typography
        -   The Exo and Roboto fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly. Both fonts were selected due to display clarity and their frequent use in website designs.

#### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   ##### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        -  Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable page providing a brief overview of who Nikolas is and what he can offer in a professional environment. 
        -  The user is presented with a visually non-ambiguous navigation bar. From there the user can easily navigate to the individual page they want to browse.
       
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find information regarding Nikolas.

        -  The site has been designed with simplicity and clarity in mind. The main elements used to navigate the website are thus presented to the user when the [landing page](https://nikolaskotsikos.github.io/NikolasKotsikos-OnlineCV/) loads.
        -  The name and the image both function as home links to easily help users navigate back to the first page of the website.
       
-   ##### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to contact Nikolas with any questions I may have.

        - There is a link to the contact page present inside the footer of three out of the four total pages, so that is easy for a returning user to get to the contact page. 
        - There are links that lead to social media where the user can connect with and message Nikolas. 
        - The form elements have been positioned and styled as intended. JavaScript functionality will be added in future versions of the website.
        - The ability to message Nikolas through use of social media links will initially function as a substitute for the missing contact form functionality.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to easily get a printable copy of Nikolas's information.

        - In every page there is an easy to find link in the footer of the page for downloading a printable summary version of the site's information in pdf.
        - The link opens the pdf in a new window so as to not interfere with navigation within the website.
   
-   ##### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added projects.

        - The user can easily navigate to the projects and skills page in order to check for new additions. 

    2.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added education milestones.

         - The user can easily navigate to the education page in order to check for new milestones. 

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to easily connect with Nikolas on social media.

        - At the bottom of every page their is a footer. Its content as it pertains to social media links is consistent throughout the website.

#### Known Bugs
