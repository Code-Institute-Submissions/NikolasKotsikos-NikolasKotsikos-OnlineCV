<h2 align="left">Nikolas Kotsikos Online CV & Portfolio</h2>


This is an online cv and portfolio web page for my  new career as a junior full stack developer. <br>
Having already several years of professional experience I am looking to make a welcoming, minimal and easy to navigate CV & Portfolio website to showcase that to potential future employers or collaborators. <br>
The website contains an about (home) page, providing general information about who I am as a professional, a work page with information on my professional skills and my projects, an education page covering my educational background and a contact page.<br>
It also provides links to connect with me on social media and an option to download a printable pdf version of my resume.<br> 
The site aims to render a positive image of me as a junior developer to people that either want to employ me or collaborate with me.<br>

*   #### Design

    -   ##### Colour Scheme
        *   The colour scheme for the website derives from a grayscale palette. The colours found on the website are off-white (#fafafa), dark grey (darkgrey), off-black (#474444)  with some icons being orange (#e98b11).

    -   ##### Typography
        *   The Exo and Roboto fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly. Both fonts were selected due to display clarity and their frequent use in website designs.

### Technologies Used

#### Languages Used

-   The site is created using [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). The decission to avoid the use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was a conscious one -with encouragement and guidance from my Mentor- and doign it forwarded my understanding of both languages significantly. 

#### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Hover.css:](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    * Hover.css was used on the nav menu buttons in the header to add a darker background colour to them while being hovered over.
2. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * Google fonts were used to import the 'Exo' & 'Roboto' fonts into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
3. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
    * Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
4. [Git:](https://git-scm.com/)
    * Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
5. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    * GitHub was used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
6. [Photoshop:](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html)
    * Photoshop was used to edit the image and adjust it for use on the website.
7. [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/)
    * Balsamiq was used to create all [wireframes](https://github.com/NikolasKotsikos/NikolasKotsikos-OnlineCV/tree/master/assets/wireframes) during the design process.



### Testing

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.<br>
The results produced errors in CSS and HTML, due to the implementation of some inventive solutions. They were submitted as received after consultation with Code Institute's tutor support over their overall importance.<br>
The results are provided below:

*   [HTML Validation Results](https://github.com/NikolasKotsikos/NikolasKotsikos-OnlineCV/tree/master/testing/html)
*   [CSS Validation Results](https://github.com/NikolasKotsikos/NikolasKotsikos-OnlineCV/blob/master/testing/CSSResults.png)


#### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

*   ##### First Time User Goals

    1. I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.

        *  Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable page providing a brief overview of who I am and what I can offer in a professional environment. 
        *  The user is presented with a visually non-ambiguous navigation bar. From there the user can easily navigate to the individual page they want to visit.
       
    2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site so as to form an impression of Nikolas as a professional.

        *  The site has been designed with simplicity and clarity in mind. The main elements used to navigate the website are thus presented to the user when the [landing page](https://nikolaskotsikos.github.io/NikolasKotsikos-OnlineCV/) loads.
        *  The name and the image both function as home links to easily help users navigate back to the first page of the website.
       
-   ##### Returning User Goals

    1. I want to contact you with any questions I may have.

        * There is a link to the contact page present inside the footer of three out of the four total pages, so that is easy for a returning user to get to the contact page. 
        * There are links that lead to social media where the user can connect with and message me. 
        * The form elements have been positioned and styled as intended. JavaScript functionality will be added in future versions of the website.
        * The ability to message me through the use of social media links will initially function as a substitute for the missing contact form functionality.

    2. I want to be able to easily get a printable resume of the information.

        * In every page there is an easy to find link in the footer of the page for downloading a printable summary version of the site's information in pdf.
        * The link opens the pdf in a new window so as to not interfere with navigation within the website.
   
-   ##### Frequent User Goals

    1. I want to check if there are any newly added projects.

        * The user can easily navigate to the projects and skills page in order to check for new additions. 

    2. I want to check if there are any newly added education milestones.

         * The user can easily navigate to the education page in order to check for new milestones. 

    3. I want to easily connect with you on social media.

         * At the bottom of every page their is a footer. Its content as it pertains to social media links is consistent throughout the website.

*   The website was posted in the [#Peer Code Review Channel](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/CGWQJQKC5/p1595435396012200) in [Slack](https://slack.com/) and shared for community feedback on [Career Karma](https://careerkarma.com/discussions/projects/personal-online-cv-portfolio-984/), receiving overall positive UX reactions.
*   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

#### Squashed Bugs
